                <h1>Coaching for Ultrarunners</h1>

                <h2 class="subtitle">Whether you're ultra-curious or ultra-experienced, I'd like to work with you to better optimize your training, dial in event strategies, and have more fun in this crazy sport.</h2>

                <p>My method is very straightforward: develop or improve structure, train within that structure, look at the results, and then adjust and repeat. I very much believe in taking a data-driven approach and making full use of all the tools and technology we have at our disposal, from gels to GPS to generative AI.</p>
                
                <p>In order to provide the best possible experience for the athletes I work with, I have a very limited number of spots available. Feel free to reach out about availability and I'll get back to you as soon as is convenient.</p>

                <p>Note that my primary focus is working with intermediate to advanced runners targeting ultra distances. If you're a newer runner, an elite athlete, or are primarily aiming for sub-ultra distances, I might not be a good fit, but send me a message anyway. I might can recommend a coach whose services are more in line with what you need.</p>

            <section id="process" class="container-lg content-bottom content-top">
                <p>We begin with a conversation about where you are with your running and where you'd like to be. We'll discuss things like races or other events you'd like to participate in, your history in the sport, long-term goals, and any struggles you've had along the way. From there, we'll discuss things like training structure, timelines, and any biomechanical and/or fitness assessments that might be beneficial/necessary. We'll also take a few moments to discuss my role as a coach, establish our expectations of one another, and discuss legal and administrative details.</p>

                <p>Weekly schedules will be delivered sufficiently in advance with nothing thrown in at the last minute or delivered "day of" without prior discussion. You'll ensure that runs and other workouts are synced and provide feedback from each activity as to how it went. Other metrics such as resting heart rate and sleep quality may be requested as well. We'll maintain ongoing communication regarding progress throughout the week and adjustments to the schedule will be made as necessary. Daily runs and other workouts will include a breakdown of desired durations at desired intensities as well as details where appropriate regarding things such as terrain, gear, hydration, and nutrition.</p>

                <p>Once weekly, we'll have a phone or video call lasting approximately 30 minutes. Here we can get into a deeper discussion regarding your training and how it's going. We'll also discuss any considerations regarding the schedule for the upcoming week (holidays, travel, life events, etc), talk about things like gear selection and event-specific strategies, and review both process and outcome goals.</p>

            </section>

            <section id="about" class="container-lg content-bottom content-top">
                <p>My name is Kendall Weaver and I'm an ultrarunner and UESCA-certified ultrarunning coach. My wife, Rachel, and I live in Hendersonville, North Carolina with our two dogs, Amos and Rupert. I have a background in operations management and software development and tend to approach most situations with an analytical mindset (and a sense of humor). As such, I spend quite a lot of time poring over articles, research papers, and meta-analyses trying to better understand concepts such as training methodology and injury prevention as they apply to the sport of ultrarunning.</p>

                <p>I've run at least a dozen official ultramarathon races, including a few 100 milers, and several dozen ultra-distance adventure runs in environments ranging from treadmills to roads and trails of all varieties (and in all sorts of weather). Within that, I've been fortunate enough to come away with a few wins, a couple of course records, and a handful of other podium finishes. In addition, I've crewed and/or paced athletes in a good many races, FKT attempts, and other adventure runs and have developed a bit of a specialty for helping people finish a nearby 100k route called Pitchell.</p>

                <p>Trail maintenance is a passion of mine, and I strongly believe that trail runners should be doing their part. As such, I encourage athletes I work with to volunteer some time with a local trail organization. Personally, I do a fair amount of work with The G5 Trail Collective located in Old Fort, NC, where I operate as a crew leader and sawyer. Since January 2021, I've been leading an effort to rehabilitate the Mackey Mountain Trail in the Grandfather Ranger District of Pisgah National Forest.</p>

                <p>I'm on the board of The RUN828 Foundation and help organize two of their races: The Hellbender 100 and The Gamble. Outside of running, I enjoy road cycling (but only when the weather is nice), experimenting with hot sauce recipes, WFPB cooking, and playing music.</p>
