                <h2 class="subtitle">100 Kilometers and 19,500 Feet in 9 Laps</h2>

                <p>Calling all masochists, gluttons for punishment, and anyone more than mildly intrigued by the <i>Hellraiser</i> movie franchise. Hold onto your butts because this race is going to hurt deep down in your soul. This is not an event for the faint of heart. <i>Leadmine Nine</i> is designed to be a world-class challenge for those who haven't yet found their limit at the 100k distance.</p>
                
                <p>The course is simple: nine laps of an approximately seven mile loop with almost 2200 feet of climbing. The loop starts with nice, moderately technical, creekside singletrack before a large climb up to a ridge. From there you'll experience a roller coaster of ups and downs before a long gravel descent back to the start. And then you have the distinct pleasure of doing it eight more times.</p>

                <p>The race will take place just north of Old Fort, North Carolina in the Grandfather Ranger District of Pisgah National Forest. Beginning at noon on October 1st, runners will have 24 hours to complete the nine laps with a time cutoff every two hours and forty minutes. Each lap you'll have an aid station, a staffed water stop, and access to your drop bag and/or crew.</p>

                <p>If the event turns a profit, 50% of it will be donated to the <a href="https://www.g5trailcollective.org/" target="_blank">G5 Trail Collective</a>, an Old Fort based non-profit that provides funding, advocacy, and volunteer support for the trails in the area. Due to potential USFS land redesignations, 2022 may be the only year this event can happen and registration is limited to only 50 spots, so get in while you can.</p>

                <p>An event handbook will be made available in the coming weeks that covers things such as parking, logistics, specific rules and expectations, etc. If you have questions in the meantime, please <a href="mailto:kendall@nc.run">contact me</a> and I'll get back to you as quickly as I'm able. This event is held under permit from the United States Forest Service.</p>
